# TensorRT_pytorch

A simple demo to train mnist in pytorch and speed up inference by TensorRT.
The training code comes from [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist) .
The code to use TensorRT comes from samples in installation package of TensorRT.

The TensorRT version we use is 5.1.5. The code may not compatible with other versions of TensorRT.
